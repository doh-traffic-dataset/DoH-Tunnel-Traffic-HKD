# The DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD dataset

* The dataset (DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD.zip) is available on the Hokkaido University website - https://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/xxxx/xxxx.

* The dataset contains PCAP files of DoH tunnel traffic generated by dnstt [1], tcp-over-dns [2], and tuns [3].

* The dataset also includes CSV files of statistical traffic features extracted from PCAP files by DoHlyzer [4].

* The "Total-48h-Augmentation.csv" includes traffic flows of dnstt 46080, tcp-over-dns 30040, tuns 29040, augmented assuming 20 client PCs.

* The destination of all tunnel tools is a suspicious DNS server.

* The dnstt directly connects to a DoH server because it supports a DoH protocol.

* On the other hand, the tcp-over-dns and tuns use DoH proxy to convert conventional DNS into DoH.
