# The DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD dataset

* The dataset contains packet capture (pcap) of DoH tunnel traffic generated by dnstt [1], tcp-over-dns [2], and tuns [3].

* The dataset also contains traffic features and traffic flows (csv) extracted by DoHlyzer [4].

* "Total-48h-Augmentation.csv" has traffic features and traffic flows consisting of dnstt 46080, tcp-over-dns 30040, tuns 29040.

* The destination of tunnel tools, including dnstt, tcp-over-dns, and tuns is a suspicious DNS server.

* The dnstt directly connects to a DoH server because it supports a DoH protocol.

* On the other hand, the tcp-over-dns and tuns use DoH proxy to convert conventional DNS into DoH.
