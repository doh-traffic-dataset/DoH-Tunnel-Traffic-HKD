# The DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD dataset

* The dataset contains PCAP files (DoH-Pcaps.zip) of DoH tunnel traffic generated by dnstt [1], tcp-over-dns [2], and tuns [3].

* The dataset also includes CSV files (DoH-CSVs.zip) of statistical traffic features extracted from PCAP files by DoHlyzer [4].

* The "Total-48h-Augmentation.csv" includes traffic flows of dnstt 46080, tcp-over-dns 30040, tuns 29040, augmented assuming 20 client PCs.

* If your papers use the dataset, please cite the following paper.

* The destination of all tunnel tools is a suspicious DNS server.

* The dnstt directly connects to a DoH server because it supports a DoH protocol.

* On the other hand, the tcp-over-dns and tuns use DoH proxy to convert conventional DNS into DoH.

# Appendix

* The "DoH-Combined-CSVs.zip" contains of CSV files of the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 and DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD combined dataset.

* The CSV files also includes traffic flows of Non-DoH 897493, DoH 374803, Normal DoH 19807, Suspicious DoH 354996, dns2tcp 167486, dnscat2 35770, iodine 46580, dnstt 46080, tcp-over-dns 30040, and tuns 29040.
 
* If you use the CSV files, please be sure to cite both studies for the datasets in your paper.
