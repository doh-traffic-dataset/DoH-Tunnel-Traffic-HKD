# The DoH-Tunnel-Traffic-HKD dataset

* The dataset contains DoH tunnel traffic generated by dnstt [1], tcp-over-dns [2], and tuns [3].

* The dataset also involves traffic features extracted by DoHlyzer [4].

* The former is DoH-Pcaps.zip (472 MB) stored with Git LFS, and the latter is DoH-CSVs.zip (12.7MB). 

* The dataset also contains traffic features extracted by DoHlyzer (2304 dnstt, 1502 tcp-over-dns, and 1452 tuns).

* The destination of tunnel tools, including dnstt, tcp-over-dns, and tuns is a suspicious DNS server.

* The dnstt directly connects to a DoH server because it supports a DoH protocol.

* On the other hand, the tcp-over-dns and tuns use DoH proxy to convert conventional DNS into DoH.
